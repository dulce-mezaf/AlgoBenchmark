# AlgoBenchmark
CSCI Algorithms and Data Structures Project 1:
Implementation of bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort and merge sort with the option of running each sort on four different types of arrays (completely shuffled, 10 percent shuffled, reversed, or ordered) of size 10, 1000, 100000, 1000000. You can run each sort variation one by one to get the time each takes or you can do data collection and run each sort variation 100 times each while sending each runâ€™s time to a text file.
